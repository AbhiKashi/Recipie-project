How to poach eggs:

Gently boil water in a large pot. If you're thinking, “What the heck is a gentle boil?” just bring the water to a boil and then lower the heat, so the water is just bubbling but not boiling like crazy. Then salt the water.
Crack your eggs into small individual cups, so they're ready to pour into the water. 
Using a spoon, begin stirring the water in a large, circular motion (like a tornado).
Once the tornado is really moving, add the eggs. The motion of the water will wrap the egg white around itself so the egg stays together as it cooks.
Cook the eggs for 2½ to 3 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon.
Enjoy the warm and tasty poached eggs with your loved ones.
